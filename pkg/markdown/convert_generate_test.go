Scenario 1: Basic slug generation from a simple string

Details:
  Description: This test ensures that the Generate function correctly converts a simple string into a slug.
Execution:
  Arrange: Create an instance of IDGenerator and a byte slice containing a simple string, e.g., "Hello World".
  Act: Invoke the Generate function using the byte slice as input.
  Assert: Use Go's testing package to assert that the output matches the expected slugified version of the input string, e.g., "hello-world".
Validation:
  The choice of assertion is based on the expected behavior of the slug.Generate function when provided with a standard string. This test is important to validate that the Generate function is correctly interfacing with the slug package and returning the expected basic slugs.

Scenario 2: Slug generation with special characters in the string

Details:
  Description: This test checks if the Generate function can handle strings with special characters and still produce a valid slug.
Execution:
  Arrange: Create an instance of IDGenerator and a byte slice containing a string with special characters, e.g., "User@#Profile!$".
  Act: Invoke the Generate function using the byte slice as input.
  Assert: Use Go's testing package to assert that the output is a correctly slugified string that omits or replaces special characters, e.g., "user-profile".
Validation:
  The assertion validates that special characters are handled according to slugification rules. This test is important because users may input strings with special characters, and the application must handle these gracefully.

Scenario 3: Slug generation from an empty string

Details:
  Description: This test verifies that the Generate function can handle an empty string input without errors.
Execution:
  Arrange: Create an instance of IDGenerator and an empty byte slice.
  Act: Invoke the Generate function using the empty byte slice as input.
  Assert: Use Go's testing package to assert that the output is an empty byte slice.
Validation:
  The assertion ensures that the Generate function does not fail or return unexpected results when given an empty input. This test is important as it checks the robustness of the function against empty inputs.

Scenario 4: Handling of strings that result in duplicate slugs

Details:
  Description: This test ensures that the Generate function can handle input strings that, after slugification, might result in duplicates, and that the IDGenerator struct's internal map is correctly updated to avoid these duplicates.
Execution:
  Arrange: Create an instance of IDGenerator with an initialized map containing a slug that could be generated from the input string. Use a byte slice containing a string that would result in a duplicate slug.
  Act: Invoke the Generate function using the byte slice as input.
  Assert: Use Go's testing package to assert that the output slug is unique and does not match the pre-existing slug in the IDGenerator's map.
Validation:
  The assertion checks that the Generate function and the IDGenerator struct work together to prevent duplicate slugs. This test is important to ensure the uniqueness of identifiers in the application.

Scenario 5: Handling of non-ASCII characters in the string

Details:
  Description: This test checks if the Generate function properly slugifies strings containing non-ASCII characters.
Execution:
  Arrange: Create an instance of IDGenerator and a byte slice containing a string with non-ASCII characters, e.g., "Café au lait".
  Act: Invoke the Generate function using the byte slice as input.
  Assert: Use Go's testing package to assert that the output slug is correctly normalized and slugified, e.g., "cafe-au-lait".
Validation:
  The assertion ensures that non-ASCII characters are normalized and included in the slug. This test is important for internationalization and ensuring that the application can handle a wide range of input characters.
