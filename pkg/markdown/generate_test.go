Scenario 1: Basic slug generation

Details:
  Description: This test verifies that the Generate function correctly converts a given string into a slug format.
Execution:
  Arrange: Create an instance of IDGenerator and a sample string "Hello World!".
  Act: Call the Generate function with the sample string.
  Assert: Verify that the returned byte slice matches the expected slug "hello-world".
Validation:
  The assertion validates that the function correctly transforms a string with spaces and punctuation into a slug using the `slug.Generate` function. This test is important to ensure that the function is producing slugs correctly for standard strings, which is a fundamental operation for the markdown package.

Scenario 2: Empty string input

Details:
  Description: This test checks the function's behavior when provided with an empty string.
Execution:
  Arrange: Create an instance of IDGenerator and an empty string.
  Act: Call the Generate function with the empty string.
  Assert: Verify that the returned byte slice is empty.
Validation:
  The assertion checks that no slug is generated for an empty string, which is expected behavior. This test is important to ensure that the function handles empty inputs gracefully without producing any output or causing errors.

Scenario 3: Non-ASCII character handling

Details:
  Description: Ensure the Generate function can handle strings with non-ASCII characters and still produce a valid slug.
Execution:
  Arrange: Create an instance of IDGenerator and a string with non-ASCII characters "Café au lait".
  Act: Call the Generate function with the non-ASCII string.
  Assert: Verify that the returned byte slice matches the expected slug "cafe-au-lait".
Validation:
  The assertion validates that non-ASCII characters are normalized to their ASCII equivalents and included in the slug. This test is critical for ensuring that the function can handle internationalized content.

Scenario 4: String with multiple consecutive spaces

Details:
  Description: Test if the Generate function correctly handles strings with multiple consecutive spaces.
Execution:
  Arrange: Create an instance of IDGenerator and a string "Multiple   Spaces".
  Act: Call the Generate function with the string containing multiple spaces.
  Assert: Verify that the returned byte slice matches the expected slug "multiple-spaces".
Validation:
  The assertion checks that consecutive spaces are replaced with a single hyphen in the slug. This test ensures that the slug generation is robust against irregular spacing in the input.

Scenario 5: String with reserved URL characters

Details:
  Description: Verify that the Generate function escapes or removes reserved URL characters to produce a valid slug.
Execution:
  Arrange: Create an instance of IDGenerator and a string with reserved URL characters "Name?Age=30&Country=USA".
  Act: Call the Generate function with the string containing reserved characters.
  Assert: Verify that the returned byte slice matches the expected slug "name-age-30-country-usa".
Validation:
  The assertion ensures that reserved URL characters that could affect URL parsing are not included in the slug. This test is necessary to prevent potential URL parsing issues.

Scenario 6: Handling of IDGenerator's internal state

Details:
  Description: Test that the internal state of IDGenerator does not affect the outcome of the Generate function.
Execution:
  Arrange: Create an instance of IDGenerator with a pre-populated 'used' map containing some slugs.
  Act: Call the Generate function with a new string that does not conflict with the 'used' map.
  Assert: Verify that the returned byte slice matches the expected slug without being affected by the 'used' map.
Validation:
  The assertion checks that the internal state (the 'used' map) does not influence slug generation since it does not appear to be used in the Generate function. This test confirms that the function is stateless and side-effect-free with respect to the 'used' map, which is important for predictable functionality.

Scenario 7: Handling of very long strings

Details:
  Description: Ensure that the Generate function can handle very long strings and still produce a valid slug.
Execution:
  Arrange: Create an instance of IDGenerator and a very long string (e.g., 1000 characters).
  Act: Call the Generate function with the very long string.
  Assert: Verify that the returned byte slice is a valid slug and does not exceed a reasonable length.
Validation:
  The assertion checks that the function can handle large inputs and that the resulting slug is within expected length constraints. This test is important for ensuring the function's robustness and preventing excessively long slugs, which could be problematic for URLs.
