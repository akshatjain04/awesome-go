Scenario 1: Standard Slug Generation

Details:
  Description: This test verifies that the Generate function produces a correct slug from a given byte slice representing a standard string with spaces and uppercase letters.
Execution:
  Arrange: Create an instance of IDGenerator and a byte slice containing the string "Hello World!".
  Act: Call the Generate function with the byte slice and a dummy NodeKind value.
  Assert: Verify that the output is a byte slice representing the slug "hello-world".
Validation:
  The assertion checks that the slug is all lowercase and that spaces are replaced with hyphens, which is the expected behavior of the slug.Generate function. This test ensures that the Generate function correctly integrates with the slug package and handles typical inputs.

Scenario 2: Empty String Input

Details:
  Description: This test ensures that the Generate function can handle an empty byte slice and returns an empty slug as expected.
Execution:
  Arrange: Create an instance of IDGenerator and an empty byte slice.
  Act: Call the Generate function with the empty byte slice and a dummy NodeKind value.
  Assert: Verify that the output is an empty byte slice.
Validation:
  The assertion confirms that no slug is generated when the input is empty, which is the expected behavior. This test is important to confirm that the function can handle empty inputs without errors.

Scenario 3: Special Characters and Punctuation

Details:
  Description: This test checks if the Generate function can handle byte slices containing special characters and punctuation correctly.
Execution:
  Arrange: Create an instance of IDGenerator and a byte slice containing the string "Markdown #1: Tips & Tricks!".
  Act: Call the Generate function with the byte slice and a dummy NodeKind value.
  Assert: Verify that the output is a byte slice representing the slug "markdown-1-tips-tricks".
Validation:
  The assertion ensures that special characters and punctuation are handled as expected by the slug.Generate function, typically by omitting them or replacing them with hyphens. This test is important because it ensures that the Generate function can process titles with various characters into a web-friendly format.

Scenario 4: Non-English Characters

Details:
  Description: This test ensures that the Generate function can handle non-English characters and still produce a valid slug.
Execution:
  Arrange: Create an instance of IDGenerator and a byte slice containing the string "CafÃ© con leche".
  Act: Call the Generate function with the byte slice and a dummy NodeKind value.
  Assert: Verify that the output is a byte slice representing the slug "cafe-con-leche".
Validation:
  The assertion checks that non-English characters are transliterated or handled appropriately. This test is important for internationalization and ensures that the slug generation is not limited to English.

Scenario 5: Long String Input

Details:
  Description: This test verifies that the Generate function can handle long string inputs without any issues.
Execution:
  Arrange: Create an instance of IDGenerator and a very long byte slice containing a repetitive string.
  Act: Call the Generate function with the byte slice and a dummy NodeKind value.
  Assert: Verify that the output is a byte slice representing a slug that is truncated to a reasonable length if necessary.
Validation:
  The assertion checks that the slug is properly created even when dealing with long inputs. This test ensures that the Generate function can handle large inputs, which is important for robustness and preventing potential buffer overflows or performance issues.

Scenario 6: Handling of Unicode Characters

Details:
  Description: This test checks if the Generate function can correctly handle byte slices with Unicode characters, such as emojis.
Execution:
  Arrange: Create an instance of IDGenerator and a byte slice containing the string "Best practices for Go ðŸš€".
  Act: Call the Generate function with the byte slice and a dummy NodeKind value.
  Assert: Verify that the output is a byte slice representing the slug "best-practices-for-go".
Validation:
  The assertion ensures that Unicode characters (emojis) are removed or handled appropriately, resulting in a clean slug. This test is crucial for ensuring the Generate function can process modern text containing emojis, which are commonly used in online content.

Scenario 7: Duplicate Slugs and ID Uniqueness

Details:
  Description: This test ensures that the IDGenerator can handle duplicate values and still produce unique slugs if necessary.
Execution:
  Arrange: Create an instance of IDGenerator with a map of previously used slugs. Generate a slug for a string that would result in a duplicate slug.
  Act: Call the Generate function with a byte slice representing a string that would result in a duplicate slug.
  Assert: Verify that the output is a byte slice representing a unique slug, potentially with a numeric suffix.
Validation:
  The assertion checks that the IDGenerator can avoid collisions with previously generated slugs. This test is important for ensuring the uniqueness of identifiers in contexts where duplicates are not allowed, such as element IDs in HTML documents.
