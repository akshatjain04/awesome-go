Scenario 1: Standard Slug Generation

Details:
  Description: This test verifies that the Generate function produces a correct slug from a given byte slice containing a standard string.
Execution:
  Arrange: Create an instance of IDGenerator and a byte slice representing a standard string "Hello World!".
  Act: Call the Generate function on the IDGenerator instance with the given byte slice.
  Assert: Check that the returned byte slice matches the expected slug "hello-world".
Validation:
  The assertion confirms that the slug.Generate function is called correctly and the result is as expected. This test is important to ensure that standard strings are handled properly and slugs are generated in a predictable manner.

Scenario 2: Empty String Input

Details:
  Description: This test ensures that the Generate function can handle an empty byte slice and returns an empty byte slice as the slug.
Execution:
  Arrange: Initialize an IDGenerator and an empty byte slice.
  Act: Invoke the Generate function with the empty byte slice.
  Assert: Confirm that the result is an empty byte slice.
Validation:
  The assertion validates that no slug is generated from empty input, which is the expected behavior. This test is crucial because it checks the function's robustness when faced with edge cases such as empty inputs.

Scenario 3: String With Special Characters

Details:
  Description: Test if the Generate function can correctly handle strings with special characters and punctuations.
Execution:
  Arrange: Prepare an IDGenerator and a byte slice with special characters "Hello, World! @2023".
  Act: Call the Generate function with this byte slice.
  Assert: Verify that the returned byte slice is a slug that omits or appropriately replaces special characters "hello-world-2023".
Validation:
  The assertion checks that the function correctly handles and sanitizes special characters. This test is significant because it ensures that the slug generation is resilient and produces clean, URL-friendly slugs.

Scenario 4: Non-ASCII Characters in Input

Details:
  Description: Ensure that the Generate function properly transliterates non-ASCII characters into ASCII equivalents where possible.
Execution:
  Arrange: Create an IDGenerator and a byte slice containing non-ASCII characters "Café Münchner".
  Act: Execute the Generate function with the non-ASCII byte slice.
  Assert: Confirm that the resulting byte slice is a slug with ASCII transliterations "cafe-munchner".
Validation:
  The assertion confirms that non-ASCII characters are transliterated correctly, which is crucial for creating slugs that are compatible with systems that only support ASCII characters.

Scenario 5: Long String Input

Details:
  Description: Test the Generate function's ability to handle long string inputs and ensure the slug is generated without truncation.
Execution:
  Arrange: Set up an IDGenerator and a long byte slice input.
  Act: Run the Generate function with the long input.
  Assert: Check that the resulting slug is complete and not truncated.
Validation:
  The assertion ensures that the function can handle long inputs without losing information, which is vital for maintaining the uniqueness and relevance of slugs generated from lengthy titles or phrases.

Scenario 6: Consecutive Spaces and Special Characters

Details:
  Description: Verify that the Generate function properly condenses consecutive spaces and special characters in the input to a single hyphen in the slug.
Execution:
  Arrange: Initialize an IDGenerator and a byte slice with consecutive spaces and special characters "Hello   --  World!!!".
  Act: Invoke the Generate function with this byte slice.
  Assert: Ensure the returned slug has condensed characters "hello-world".
Validation:
  The assertion checks that the slug is normalized, with no consecutive hyphens, which is essential for creating clean and readable slugs. This test confirms that the function can handle and normalize messy input strings.

Scenario 7: Handling of Numeric Input

Details:
  Description: This test checks if the Generate function can correctly handle numeric input and produce a valid slug.
Execution:
  Arrange: Create an IDGenerator and a byte slice containing only numbers "12345".
  Act: Call the Generate function with the numeric byte slice.
  Assert: Verify that the returned byte slice is a slug consisting of the numbers "12345".
Validation:
  The assertion ensures that numeric inputs are correctly processed into slugs, which is important for cases where titles or identifiers are numeric.
